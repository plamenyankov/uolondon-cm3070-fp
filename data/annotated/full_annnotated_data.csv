Francis Ngannou's REACTION!,2023-09-30T14:47:55Z,PT7M28S,"Welcome, dear fight fans, to a moment we've all been yearning for! The boxing world is buzzing with excitement as Tyson Fury, the reigning WBC world heavyweight champion, gears up to face Alexander Usyk, who holds the WBA, IBF, WBO, and IBO titles, in a historic clash for the absolute world champion title.

But the journey to this epic showdown has been far from straightforward. Multiple attempts to make this fight happen have faltered, leaving fans skeptical. Has destiny finally brought these two titans together, or is it just another tease?

The surprise twist in this tale centers around none other than Francis Ngannou, who seems deeply offended by Fury's willingness to take on Usyk just months after facing him. Is Ngannou justified in feeling snubbed, or does he recognize his limitations in the boxing world?

Join us as we unravel the dramatic backstory, the tumultuous negotiations, and the controversies surrounding this colossal bout. Whether you're a boxing aficionado or an MMA enthusiast, this showdown promises to etch its name in combat sports history.",274,35499,324,Usyk and his team have said NOTHING about the Fury fight.

Here's my DOUBLE NAUGHTY Nord VPN offer: https://nordvpn.com/propa

Big Bang Zhilei Zhang has arrived, after knocking out Joe joyce and beating him for the second time Zhang has put himself firmly in the mix of the top boxers on the planet - but can he beat the big 4? Tyson Fury, Usyk, Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder? Well let's have a look at how those fights could play out, especially the Anthony Joshua fight that Eddie Hearn has shown interest in, Frank Warren will be all over that fight, and it will be great for boxing. So with Tyson Fury Usyk potentially locked in, with Anthony Joshua and Wilder not able to seal a deal, could Zhang find himself against one of these boys soon, and can he get a knockout like he did against big Joe Joyce?
