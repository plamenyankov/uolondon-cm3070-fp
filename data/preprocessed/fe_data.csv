Your boxing channel. News, Talk Shows, Podcasts & Live Fights. Our motivation for creating ProBox TV is simple. Boxing fans have been taken for granted. They’ve been underserved regarding the quality of content. Further, the other networks involved in boxing lack a commitment to the sport, the fighters and most importantly, the fans. Real fight fans need an “all-boxing channel” fully focused on giving fans what they want.

Big Bang Zhilei Zhang has arrived, after knocking out Joe joyce and beating him for the second time Zhang has put himself firmly in the mix of the top boxers on the planet - but can he beat the big 4? Tyson Fury, Usyk, Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder? Well let's have a look at how those fights could play out, especially the Anthony Joshua fight that Eddie Hearn has shown interest in, Frank Warren will be all over that fight, and it will be great for boxing. So with Tyson Fury Usyk potentially locked in, with Anthony Joshua and Wilder not able to seal a deal, could Zhang find himself against one of these boys soon, and can he get a knockout like he did against big Joe Joyce?

Big Bang Zhilei Zhang has arrived, after knocking out Joe joyce and beating him for the second time Zhang has put himself firmly in the mix of the top boxers on the planet - but can he beat the big 4? Tyson Fury, Usyk, Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder? Well let's have a look at how those fights could play out, especially the Anthony Joshua fight that Eddie Hearn has shown interest in, Frank Warren will be all over that fight, and it will be great for boxing. So with Tyson Fury Usyk potentially locked in, with Anthony Joshua and Wilder not able to seal a deal, could Zhang find himself against one of these boys soon, and can he get a knockout like he did against big Joe Joyce?

It would not be the first time Tyson Fury and even his dad big John Fury have taken all us boxing fans for a boxing ride. Maybe Fury vs Usyk is a done deal..maybe...

GdT9MaqyqXY,Tyson Fury vs. Oleksandr Usyk  A CLOSER LOOK | Full Fight Highlights Analysis Head-to-Toe Breakdown!,2023-12-29T00:23:44Z,PT15M51S,"Tyson Fury vs Oleksandr Usyk will be the biggest clash of heavyweight fighters since Mike Tyson vs Michael Spinks, in terms of the spoils on offer for the victor.

With Fury holding the WBC title and Usyk holding the WBO, IBF and WBA, a mega-fight between these two would be the first time all four belts were up for grabs in an Undisputed Heavyweight title fight.

After Usyk successfully defeated Anthony Joshua in their rematch last August, the Ukrainian called out Fury in his post-fight interview, saying ""I’m sure that Tyson Fury is not retired yet. I’m sure, I’m convinced he wants to fight me. I want to fight him and if I’m not fighting Tyson Fury, I’m not fighting at all.""


Fury responded on Twitter, not just once either, however, the first post has since been deleted. In his response, he stated how poor the Joshua vs Usyk 2 fight was and how he could “annihilate both of them on the same night”.

Ever since Usyk's last fight, there have been many conversations and interactions between both sides to make the fight happen. Even with Fury fighting and beating Derek Chisora in December 2022, the main goal has seemingly always been Fury vs Usyk.

Talks for the fight have stalled for now, however they are set to resume and hopefully the fight will still happen.

With the fight almost confirmed, we have decided to do a matchup between the two Heavyweights ahead of time. We’ll take a look at the tale of the tape for the two brutes, as well as speculate where and when the fight could happen based on the rumours circulating.

Fury has fought twice in 2022 compared to Usyk’s one bout.  He first fought against Dillian Whyte in London, England. Then, after a short retirement, he fought Derek Chisora at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on 3rd December 2022.

Fury’s fight with Chisora acted as more of a tune-up than anything. Chisora, who had also stated his retirement earlier in the year, was never able to properly attack the ‘Gypsy King’, and as such Fury dictated and dominated the fight.

With his victory, Fury retained his WBC, meaning that it will still be up for grabs in his fight against Usyk.

For Oleksandr Usyk, his last fight was a rematch against Anthony Joshua at King Abdullah Sports City, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on 20th August 2022.

This rematch came after Usyk beat Joshua in October 2021 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, in London, England, and thus took the WBA, WBO and IBF belts from Joshua.

Usyk beat AJ once more in Jeddah by a split decision, although it was a strong performance from the Ukrainian.

When the talks first happened earlier in 2022, Fury claimed he’d only come out of retirement for a £500 million purse, split 50/50 between the two fighters.

Since he first stated that, Fury has come out of retirement, and the factors that would have driven the fight up to that half-a-billion figure have fallen through.

The exact purse is unknown at this time. What is known is Fury will be getting a large amount after offering a 70/30 purse split in his favour, which Usyk accepted.

Previously, Usyk's team had sent over offers of a 50/50 split and 60/40 to the winner, each rejected by Fury before he sent his own offer.

Where and when will the fight be held?
Fury’s US promoter Bob Arum previously spoke to Sky Sports about the fight, and when asked about the date and location, he revealed that they “are balancing a couple of significant offers from the Mid East and also there's the possibility of doing the fight in the UK”.

When the £500 million purse was being thrown around, the Middle East seemed like the only option to accommodate that figure.

However, the proposed Saudi Arabia location fell through when the venue contractors said the stadium in which it was going to be held will not be ready by the proposed fight date.

This has now meant the fight has moved from a neutral location to one that suits Fury more, as it is reported that the fight will now happen in London, England.

When it’s all said and done, this fight, should it happen, will be immense. Two fantastic fighters, both who could walk away from the fight with everyone saying they are worthy champions.

For us though, we can only see one winner. And call us biased, but we believe Tyson Fury would be able to get the job done.

It will be a heavy fight, both fighters will go for it. But Fury has the advantage. He has the height and the reach on Usyk, and he can match him for his technical ability.

Usyk's hopes will lie on his ability to get inside and close to Fury, because he won't be able to match him if he stays outside and lets Fury dictate the fight - things that Usyk will be very aware of.

At the end of the day, we can see this one going the full length, with the result coming via a split-decision victory for Fury.

The last undisputed champion in the heavyweight division, Lennox Lewis, earned that distinction in 1999 when he fought and beat then IBF and WBA champion, Evander Holyfield in their rematch, after their initial bout earlier that same year concluded in a controversial draw. More than 20 years later and we are on the brink of an undisputed heavyweight title fight. Taking place this coming February the 17th, Kingdom Arena in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia will be the venue to host the first heavyweight undisputed bout in almost a quarter of a century. The event, dubbed “Ring of Fire” is a much anticipated and historical occasion. Who do you think wins? Let us know in the comments below.
