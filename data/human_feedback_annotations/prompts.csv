8,"Annotation Task:  Analyze the sentiment of the given YouTube comment related to the boxing match between Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk.  Details to Note:  Tyson Fury might be referred to by nicknames like 'Gypsy King'. Oleksandr Usyk might be mentioned as 'Usyk' or by his nationality. The comment could discuss boxing strategy, the fighters' characteristics, or their nationalities. Focus on sentiment towards each fighter, expressed or implied, and ignore situational or speculative content. Sentiment Categorization:  Positive: Shows support, admiration, or confidence in the fighter. Negative: Contains criticism, doubt, or disapproval of the fighter. Neutral: Presents factual information, is ambiguous, or equally combines positive and negative sentiments. Examples for Clarification:  A comment like 'Usyk seemed less sharp than in his previous fight, but I hope it's just a matter of preparation' shows mixed sentiment for Usyk (positive hope for improvement, negative observation of performance). 'Usyk isn't intimidated by Fury and will face him confidently' is positive for Usyk and neutral for Fury, as it praises Usyk's bravery without commenting on Fury's qualities. 'This delays any fights for Usyk until next year' is neutral for Usyk, focusing on circumstances rather than qualities or performance. Comments on unrelated topics or third parties without direct sentiment towards the fighters are considered neutral for both. Response Format: Reply with the sentiment for each fighter mentioned, in lowercase, as 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral'. If both fighters are mentioned, separate the sentiments with a comma. Example: 'usyk: positive, fury: neutral'."
9,"Annotation Task for BERT Model Training:  You will annotate YouTube comments related to a boxing match. Your annotations will help train a BERT model to understand sentiments in the context of boxing discussions.  Sentiment Categories:  Positive: Comments that clearly express support, admiration, or positive critique of a fighter's performance, skills, or character. Use phrases and keywords indicative of positive sentiment. Negative: Comments that express dissatisfaction, criticism, or negative observations about a fighter's abilities, performance, or character. Look for clear negative language. Neutral: Default to neutral for comments that are ambiguous, purely factual, or unrelated to the fighters' performances or characters. Key Guidelines:  Keyword Focus: Pay special attention to keywords and phrases commonly associated with positive or negative sentiments in boxing. Use the provided lexicon as a reference. Performance Comments: Prioritize sentiments related to a fighter's performance in the ring, including technique, stamina, and strategy. Contextual Clues: Consider the context, especially when comments reference past fights or performances. The implied sentiment can guide your annotation. Handling Mixed Sentiments: If a comment contains mixed sentiments, assess the overall tone. If equally mixed, mark as neutral; otherwise, choose the dominant sentiment. Ambiguity Rule: When in doubt, classify ambiguous sentiments as neutral to maintain consistency. Response Format: Annotate each comment with 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral' for the sentiment expressed towards the fighters. Provide your annotations in lowercase, separated by commas if both fighters are mentioned. Example: 'usyk: positive, fury: negative'.  Remember, your consistent and accurate annotations are crucial for the success of the BERT model's training. Let's aim for high-quality, objective, and clear annotations based on these guidelines."
